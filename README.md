This is official repo for "MedAgent: **Med**ical Guidelines Recommendation System Based on Retrieval Augmented Retrieval and **Agent**ic AI Workflows" by DBIS at RWTH Aachen University
([Yongli Mou*](mou@dbis.rwth-aachen.de), Hanbin Chen, Meret Unbehaun, Saif Nasir and Stefan Decker) and University Hospital Aachen (Nadine Önelmis and Behrus Puladi)

## Overview

The Medical Guidelines Recommendation System (MedAgent) is an advanced AI-powered solution designed to assist healthcare professionals in making informed medical decisions by providing personalized, evidence-based medical guidelines. This system leverages the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Agentic AI workflows to create a robust framework for dynamic interaction between users (doctors) and the system, and to facilitate continuous learning and adaptation through a Retrieve-and-Generate (RAG) pipeline.


## Features
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: At the core of the system, LLMs such as GPT-based models are utilized to understand medical queries and generate responses in natural language, ensuring that recommendations are presented in an intuitive, easy-to-understand format for doctors.

- **Agentic AI Workflow**: This component enables the system to perform complex tasks autonomously. It orchestrates the interaction between different models and databases, ensuring a smooth process for retrieving relevant medical guidelines, processing them, and providing actionable insights. The agentic behavior allows the system to adapt to different contexts based on user input and system status.

- **RAG Pipeline**: The system integrates the Retrieve-and-Generate (RAG) pipeline, which enables it to query relevant databases for up-to-date medical information. This includes using retrieval-based techniques to extract the most relevant data from external sources (e.g., medical research, guidelines databases) and then generating personalized recommendations or explanations for the doctor.

Role-based Interactions: The system is designed to serve two primary user roles:

- **Doctors (End-users)**: They interact with the system to receive medical recommendations, guidelines, and insights based on patient data and clinical queries.
- **Knowledge Maintainers (Developers)**: These users are responsible for keeping the system's knowledge base up to date, ensuring that medical guidelines and AI models are regularly improved and trained to handle emerging medical trends and innovations.


## Components

- Frontend (Next.js): The user interface is built with Next.js, providing a modern, responsive, and fast application where doctors can input queries, review recommendations, and interact with the AI-powered assistant. The frontend communicates with the backend (Flask) to handle the logic and AI operations.

- Backend (Flask): The backend is built with Flask, handling API requests, interacting with databases, running AI models, and serving the AI-generated guidelines and recommendations to the frontend.
  
- Databases:
  - Postgres is used to store and manage structured medical data.
  - Neo4j (Graph Database) is used for knowledge representation, allowing the system to model medical relationships, such as drug interactions or disease pathways.
  - Vector Database (e.g., FAISS or similar) is employed to store and query embeddings of medical guidelines and knowledge for efficient retrieval.

- Authentication & Security: The system uses Keycloak for secure authentication and user management. This ensures that only authorized personnel (e.g., doctors and developers) can access the system and modify sensitive data.



## Installation

### 前置要求

- Python 3.10 或更高版本
- Node.js 18 或更高版本
- Conda 包管理器
- npm 包管理器

### 后端部署

1. 创建并激活 Conda 环境
```bash
# 创建环境
conda create --name medagent python=3.10

# 激活环境
conda activate medagent

# 进入后端目录
cd backend

# 安装依赖
pip install -e .
```

2. 启动后端服务
```bash
# 开发模式启动（支持热重载）
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

服务将在 http://127.0.0.1:8000 上运行。

### 前端部署

1. 安装依赖
```bash
# 进入前端目录
cd frontend

# 安装依赖
npm install
```

2. 启动开发服务器
```bash
npm run dev
```

前端将在 http://localhost:3000 上运行。

### Docker-compose

## Datasets

## Usage

Here's an example of how to use the model:

```python
from api.llms.azure import AzureChatCompletion
llm = AzureChatCompletion(azure_endpoint="https:your_endpoint.azure.com", azure_deployment="your_deployment_name", azure_api="your_azure_api", azure_api_version="your_api_version")
```

More detailed tutorials can be found in our [documentation](https://your-project-website.com/docs).

## Internationalization (i18n)

MedAgent supports English, Chinese, and German languages, implemented using `react-i18next` and `i18next` with dynamic language switching, JSON translation texts, and modularized file structure. To add a new language, update `settings.ts`, create a new language folder, add a translation file, and update the language switcher component.

### 快速启动

我们提供了一个便捷的脚本来同时启动前端和后端服务：

```bash
# 添加执行权限
chmod +x start.sh

# 运行脚本
./start.sh
```

该脚本会自动：
- 检查必要的依赖是否安装
- 创建并激活 conda 环境（如果不存在）
- 安装所需的依赖
- 启动后端服务（http://127.0.0.1:8000）
- 启动前端服务（http://localhost:3000）

你可以使用 `Ctrl+C` 来同时停止所有服务。
